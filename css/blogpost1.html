         <p class="font1">Data Science Notebook Life-Hacks I Learned From Ploomber by Nóra Balogh on March 2, 2022 in Partner Tweet Tweet  Share
            Last Updated on March 3, 2022Photo by Hannah Wei on Unsplash Sponsored Post Me, a data scientist, and Jupyter notebooks. Well, our relationship started back then when I began to learn Python. Jupyter notebooks were my refuge when I wanted to make sure that my code works. Nowadays, I teach coding and do several data science projects and still, notebooks are the best tools for interactive coding and experimentation. Unfortunately, when trying to use notebooks in data science projects, things can get out of control quickly. As a result of experimentation, monolithic notebooks emerge, which are hard to maintain and modify. And yes, it’s very time-consuming to work twice: experiment and then transform your code to Python scripts. Not to mention, it’s painful to test such code, and version control is also a problem. This is the point when you must think, there has to be a better way! Lucky me, the answer is not in avoiding my beloved Jupyter notebooks.
            Follow me and get to know some awesome ideas from Eduardo Blancas and his project, called Ploomber on how to do better data science projects and how to use and create Jupyter notebooks wisely, even in production.</p>
